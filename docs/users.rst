Users

For the purposes of content editing there are 3 user roles we use:

1. Editor - our paid staff, somebody who can publish and manage posts including the posts of other users.
2. Author - folks who have content published on TOS but it's entered/managed by our editors. These users never login.
3. Contributor â€“  folks who have content published on TOS but it must be reviewed by an editor before being published. These users do login.

Authors
-------
If you have received content from an outside author and need to enter it into wordpress,
this section is for you!

To accomplish the above you must create the user in a unique way. Usually when a user is created an
email is sent with login instructions. Because this user will never login we will use a dummy email address.

Create The Author Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. In the admin navigate to ``Users`` and click the ``Add New`` button at the top of the page.
2. Under the second section ``Add New User`` fill out the following information:
    1. Username - all lower case concatenate the first and last name ``benjaminsternthal``
    2. Email - use the following email ``TOSEditors+username@mozilla.com`` example TOSEditors+benjaminsternthal@mozilla.com
    3. Role - select ``Author``.
    4. Check this box - ``Add the user without sending an email that requires their confirmation.``
    5. Save - do not upload a profile image from this screen.

.. important::  Wordpress will always send out an email with login information, since these users are not logging in you must always use the email ``TOSEditors+username@mozilla.com``

.. important::  Wordpress will send an email to the editor account. This email should be ignored.

.. note::  Comment moderation emails will be sent to ``TOSEditors+username@mozilla.com`` for their respective articles.

Populate The Author Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once the author account is created you can edit it to add biographical information and a photo.

1. In the admin navigate to ``Users`` ``All Users`` and ``Edit`` the author.
